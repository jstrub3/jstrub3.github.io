In early 2019 I switched from game development to B2B software application development and was presented with a different set of performance review mechanics (as often are in various companies).  I was asked to document all career training, however small, and this would be used alongside other metrics for determining year-to-year career growth.  I had always been drawn to lifelong learning, but never felt a need to document it.  So I started in April 2019 and am now looking back on a year's worth of training, books, projects, etc.

I've attached my tracking document at the end of this post, so feel free to ping me about a review on anything.  In addition to the actual material, there's a lot to learn about learning.

## Takeaway 1: The Real World doesn't have Midterms
Aside from LinkedIn Learning and Udemy quizes, you often won't find a way to test your newfound skills or even confirm that you've gotten the knowledge you seek.  The real test is back in the workplace where you suddenly realize that the code you've been reviewing could stand to be 'cleaner', or that a UI design document makes perfect sense now.  I found greater respect for other software development disciplines if I force myself to learn a bit about their best practices.  You aren't going to boost your GPA with much of the career training, but you'll boost your well-roundedness for sure, and managers absolutely take notice.


## Takeaway 2: Hit the Soft Skills Hard
Some of the biggest training breakthrough I noticed were not in technical books or courses, but books or courses focusing on interpersonal skills, time/project management, and non-technical fields.  You can get most of the "T-shaped" skills on the job, as you should, since this is where you are applying your current expertise.  Outside of work is where you're expected to learn the ancillary skills that take someone from a high-performer to an excellent team member.


## Takeaway 3: Your Commute is your Best Friend
Almost everything that I've done in 2019 when it comes to outside-the-job training was during my 2 45-min train rides during the week.  This is the perfect time to pop open my Kindle and get a chapter or two down.  I find that reading in the morning ramps up my brain for a day of complex thought.  My evening commute is perfect for non-technical training to help wind-down and shift focus from code to more conversational reading.  
I've noticed that since the COVID-19 shelter-in-place measures have forced me to work from home, my progress has severely slowed... mostly because I have less time to dedicate to off-the-job training.  


Below is the table of my 2019 personal training.  Originally shooting for 300 hours, I was able to put in over 420 hours in total!
