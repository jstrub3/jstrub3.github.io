title: Software Engineering and the Games Industry
---
I've been doing software engineering for video games for the better part of a decade, working on mobile and console, vehicle and brawler, UI and backend.  I'm intending this space to serve as a place to collect and document my toy, experimental, and learning applications made in Unity, UE4, and Processing.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
