In August 2019 I joined Wargaming Chicago-Baltimore as a UI software engineer and wanted to seed some good vibes with my new team, so I started baking.  I’d bring in cookies, breakfast breads, biscotti, and other snacks every other week, much to the delight of my coworkers.  In addition to the brownie points, I could feel my culinary skills increase and my kids loved “helping” me with my latest batch.  I started right away to notice several similarities to the software engineering process.

## Following Recipe - Following Design
The obvious one is this: following instructions in order and within specified constraints.  This means either 1 1/2 cups flour, or not over 128 MB memory budget.  Steps must be taken in order for the output to be as described and desired.  Often in baking you’ll construct sub-recipes before combining them at the proper time (combining all dry ingredients before mixing in a prepared wet mixture).  Similarly, software can be built the same way; smalller, modular components are eventually combined into a working, complex system.

A large part of following a recipe or design is knowing as much as you can before starting.  I once attempted a chocolate babka without realizing that the dough needed to rest for 24 hours overnight... I was expecting to have it ready later that day!  This was a footnote on the recipe, but dramatically changed the time-to-completion I had planned (luckily this was on a Saturday so there wasn’t a rush).  I can also count the number of times that I’ve started building a software feature only to realize that my initial assumptions were 1) addressed further in the design and 2) wrong.

## Resting Dough - Stepping Away from the Task
The chocolate babka from above used an enriched dough, which typically has at least one period of rising.  For those of us without culinary vocabulary, this means that the yeast in the dough will ferment and produce gas, which causes the dough to expand.  I’ll often prepare a dough in the morning, and allow it to rise midday, and continue with the recipe in the afternoon.  In addition to this, sometimes dough needs additional time to rest after being worked, so the gluten can relax and the dough to become easier to work with again.  

These times allow the dough to do it’s thing, but it also provides some direct advantages to me.  I can review the recipe, work on another dish, or do something else entirely like play with my kids.  In software development I sometimes hit walls where I cannot figure out the solution.  In these situations, I take a walk, work on another task, or just stop entirely.  Taking breaks allows your brain to shift priority and your subconscious to work on the new inputs, many times making connections back to the original frustrating problem. This time away from a software problem gives the same benefits as time away from a bake, and often coming back to the situation the “dough” of the problem is much easier to work out.

## Retrospectives
My wife is an experienced baker, and I am not.  So at the end of every recipe, we gather around the final product, taste a couple samples, and talk about what went wrong, what new techniques I learned, and what I could have done better the next time.  Sound familiar?  Retrospectives reveal insights into the good, the bad, and the ugly practices that we should all try to refine.  This is the time where the old bulls can pass down knowledge, and we all reflect on the soft-skills that we’ve learned during the course of the task.  Learning to bake has helped to develop my skills in “eyeballing” measurements, culinary vocabulary, and advanced appliance operations (when to put foil over cinnamon rolls?  Difference between chop and dice? etc).  The same can be said for software development.  Clean code isn’t learned from a class, but from reading, writing, and editing code over and over.  This is the muscle-memory of our brain when designing classes and structures, much the same as the muscle-memory of our hands when whisking vs folding.
